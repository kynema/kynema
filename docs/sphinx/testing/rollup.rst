Static rollup of an isotropic beam
----------------------------------

In this benchmark test, we examine the static pure bending of an isotropic beam of 10 units in
length. Under the application of a specific moment, the beam rolls up into a circular curve and
the exact analytical tip displacement (in the direction of the beam length) is -10. Details of
the benchmark problem are described in [@Simo-VuQuoc:1986]. The following table shows the tip
displacement calculated with a single Legendre Spectral Finite Element (LSFE) with the number
of nodes shown. N-Point Gauss-Legendre quadrature was employed, where N is the number of nodes.
The results show the expected spectral convergence to the exact solution.
