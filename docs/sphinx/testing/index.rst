Benchmark Testing
=================

This section describes the testing results for Kynema, including code verification, code-to-code comparisons, and validation.

Verification Overview
---------------------

In the context of the Kynema documentation, "verification" refers to the comparison of code-to-code
and code-to-analytical results. Verification ensures that Kynema correctly implements the underlying
mathematical models and numerical methods, i.e., there are no implementation errors/bugs in the
code and the error introduced by the discretization and numerical computation is within acceptable
limits.
