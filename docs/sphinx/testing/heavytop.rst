Heavy Top Dynamic Problem
--------------------------------

For this benchmark problem, we use the heavy top problem to evaluate the convergence rate of the Kynema Lie-group generalized-alpha time integrator.   The problem is a rotating body fixed to the ground by a spherical joint and is described in detail in [@Bruls-etal:2012].   

Our benchmark solution is a Kynema simulation with a time step size of :math:`10^{-5}` seconds and we examine the vertical displacement at the end of two seconds.
